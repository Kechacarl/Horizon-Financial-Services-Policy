Document ID: SEC-FIN-POL-2025-01 Version: 1.0 Effective Date: August 18, 2025


1. Policy Statement & Scope
This policy establishes the framework for managing risk, responding to incidents, and ensuring regulatory compliance for Horizon Financial Services. Its purpose is to protect the organization's assets, reputation, and client data, and to ensure we operate with integrity and in full accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organization's systems, data, or facilities.

2. Risk Management Framework
Our risk management framework is a continuous process designed to proactively identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks.

2.1. Risk Identification
We will systematically identify potential risks across all business units. This includes, but is not limited to:

Financial Risk: Credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk.

Operational Risk: System failures, human error, fraud.

Cybersecurity Risk: Data breaches, ransomware attacks, phishing.

Compliance Risk: Failure to adhere to regulations like GDPR, SOX, or AML/KYC.

Reputational Risk: Negative public perception resulting from an incident.

2.2. Risk Assessment
All identified risks will be assessed based on their likelihood of occurring and the potential impact they would have on the organization. We maintain a centralized risk register to categorize risks as high, medium, or low to prioritize our mitigation efforts.

2.3. Risk Mitigation
For each high- and medium-priority risk, a mitigation strategy will be developed. This may include:

Acceptance: Accepting the risk and its potential consequences.

Avoidance: Ceasing an activity that generates the risk.

Transfer: Shifting the risk to a third party, such as through insurance.

Control: Implementing controls and safeguards to reduce the risk. This is the most common approach and includes measures like employee training, enhanced security protocols, and system redundancy.

2.4. Risk Monitoring & Reporting
Identified risks and their mitigation strategies will be continuously monitored. The Risk Management Committee will provide regular reports to the Board of Directors, detailing the current risk landscape and the effectiveness of our controls.

3. Incident Response Plan
An incident is an event that compromises the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the organization's systems or data. Our response plan is designed to contain, manage, and recover from such events with minimal disruption.

3.1. Phases of Response
The incident response process is divided into six phases:

Preparation: This includes training staff, having a clear communication plan, and maintaining a contact list of all key personnel and external partners (e.g., legal counsel, IT forensics).

Detection & Analysis: The moment an incident is suspected, it must be reported immediately. The Incident Response Team will analyze the event to determine its nature, scope, and severity.

Containment: The priority is to limit the damage. This may involve isolating affected systems, shutting down network connections, or revoking user access.

Eradication: Once contained, the root cause of the incident is identified and eliminated. This might involve removing malware, patching vulnerabilities, or addressing a specific employee's actions.

Recovery: Affected systems and data are restored to normal operation from a secure backup. The business can resume its functions.

Post-Incident Review: A thorough review of the incident is conducted to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. This review will inform updates to our policies and procedures.

3.2. Communication
Clear and timely communication is critical. The Incident Response Team, led by the CISO, will communicate with internal stakeholders, affected clients, and, where legally required, regulatory bodies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

4. Regulatory Compliance
We are committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations governing the financial services industry.

4.1. Key Regulations
Our compliance program addresses key regulations, including:

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): We will maintain robust procedures to verify client identities and monitor for suspicious transactions in accordance with FinCEN regulations.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): We will ensure our financial reporting and disclosure controls are accurate and reliable.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): We will protect cardholder data and maintain a secure processing environment.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) & California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): We will handle all client data with the utmost care, respecting privacy rights and ensuring its security.

4.2. Compliance Program
Our program includes:

Ongoing Monitoring: We will continuously monitor for changes in regulations and adjust our policies accordingly.

Audits & Reviews: Regular internal and external audits will be conducted to ensure our controls are effective.

Training & Awareness: All employees will receive mandatory training on compliance policies and procedures.
